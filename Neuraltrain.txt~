Have a test dataset and a training dataset
passing Datasets to dataloaders

Networks are made in Models
in forward function we specify how the data will be passed e.g Matrix into
bytes(.flatten)

To train models we need loss and optimizer functions

need to test if the model is learning 

Use tensors to encode input output of a model as well as the parameters
